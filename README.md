## Introduction
The interface to communicate with HelloID is through a set of API endpoints, which are accessible with the use of the HelloID API Key and Secret. Warning: The API is very powerful, therefore the API key and secret must be kept private and be used with care.
Please see the following page from the HelloID Docs for more information.
